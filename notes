Ok the swap phase is done.
when it comes to programming this on the server, we will broadcast all swap events to all players, and wait until everyone is OK.
during this phase we will need to send card that were swapped to the player.

For multiplay (playing multiple cards of the same rank) use space to bring up a menu that allows the player to select:
- Play 1
- Play 2
- Play 3
- Play 4
Grey out options where the user does not have the cards necessary.


for storing cards on the server we only need 1 byte for the rank and 1 for the suit, we should make some conversation functions
so that we can store this data in a uintptr_t for use in data / content of linked list / cdll.

Rework the input the send the ncevent instead of the keycode, this way we can handle the resize events on the fly

Methods for hand and pile to reset selection, clear selection, and update selection.
Because there are multiple times where selection either doesnt show or doesnt point to the right card.

MLX ideas for minirt:

- Menu, much like the one we have here with options for dynamic and static text, on-select and on-deselect
- Drag and drop for files.
- Fonts
- Gradient fills
- Better line drawing API
